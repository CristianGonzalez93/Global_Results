This project is just to show the global results of all the players who play the rankeds with the CTR_Switch_Bot (https://github.com/CristianGonzalez93/CTR_Switch_Bot)

To make it run you would just need to install java 11 and config the data base to mongoDB. It should be the same data base is using the CTR_Switch_Bot.
